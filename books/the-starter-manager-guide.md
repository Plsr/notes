#[The Starter Manager Guide](https://commoncog.com/g/starter-manager/)

This is a short digital books targeted at first-time managers in a startup environment.  
The book is about 3 hours to read and should have enough content to take 6 - 8 Months to implement.

## What is the Managers Job?
> “the manager’s job is to increase the output of the team.”

Everything you do should be for that single purpose.

### Why does Management get such a bad rep?
- Most activities a manager performs over the course of the day do not have any _direct_ business impact. 
  - It therefor is hard for people to understand why a manager should exist in the first place
- Managers cannot evaluate their value merely on the activities they're doing, they need a different model for evaluating their impact: Managerial Leverage

### Managerial Leverage
- Managers activities are good or bad measured on how they influenced the output of their team
  - Example: Engineer needs spec to start project. If you have the spec ready thats good. If not, thats bad. If you rushed it and it is ready but wrong, that's really bad.

### The Manager’s Job as Your North Star
- First: If a manager's job is to increase team output, every technique should be evaluated by how it helps to achieve that goal
  - When learning a new technique, answer these questions:
    - How has it helped to author improve team output?
    - How may I adapt it?
    - Once applied, how will I measure success?
  - Measuring success can be objective ("Metric X increased") of subjective ("Ask the team")
- Second: Change the way you look a your growth
  - Your management career is an optimization problem
  - Every week, take time to reflect wether you increased or decreased the teams output this week
